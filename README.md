# ui-test-zemoga

UI developed using the next dependencies:
* React 16.12.0
* React router 5.1.2
* Babel 7.7.7
* Eslint 6.8.0
* Webpack 4.41.5

and some other libraries that helped to create a functional product. 

Addicionally, I created a *Not Found* page, to the redirect from menu and the website has a functional responsive design that works with 6 querys (1200px, 1025px, 769px, 576px, 500px, 414px). The next image is a screenshot from the running project.
