# ui-test-zemoga

UI developed using React.js, Router, webpack, sass for styles, and other libraries that help to create a functional product. 

I create a *Not Found* page, to the redirect from menu and the website has a functional responsive design that works with 6 querys (1200px, 1025px, 769px, 576px, 500px, 414px)

## Instalation

### Note:
The branch interactive is not finish, the next step should be add a function to set localstorage and handling the state to update the data.
